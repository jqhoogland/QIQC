# QIQC
Exercises and project for a course in my bachelors: Quantum Information &amp; Quantum Communication

*From the [course catalogue](https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2019-2020-en/search-course/course/68570)*:

## Objectives
After successfully completing the course, the student is able to:
1. Use techniques from quantum information theory to solve problems about quantum communication and quantum computation.
2. Describe in mathematical detail the main protocols for quantum key distribution (such as BB84 and E91) and assess their limitations.
3. Apply entropy measures to quantify information and discuss the security of protocols.
4. Describe in mathematical detail the main algorithms for quantum computing (such as Shor’s factoring algorithm and Grover’s search algorithm).
5. Explain the main technologies used for physical signal processing and quantum information processing devices, and relate physical realizations to problems of quantum state decoherence.
6. Explain the impact of the different interpretations of quantum mechanics on quantum communication, and critically assess the experimental bounds placed on the different interpretations.
7. Discuss the main semantic and ontological problems associated with the notion of information.

## Contents
Information and communication are not only of social and economic relevance, but they also lie at the core of many scientific and technological innovations. Quantum information is increasingly seen as a physical quantity, with a role in contemporary science and technology that is similar to the role of the notion of energy in fuelling the industrial revolution.

This course offers a multidisciplinary approach to quantum information, quantum communication, and quantum computing. It develops the main mathematical and theoretical tools required to analyse questions such as how to use quantum mechanics to ensure the security of communications (quantum cryptography), and how quantum mechanics can be used to build computer algorithms that are more efficient than the classical ones. It also introduces the student to the physical realizations of our communication and computation technologies, with emphasis on the new challenges inherent in quantum information processing and quantum communications. Finally, it addresses conceptual and philosophical questions about locality, causality and contextuality of quantum communication and the relevant mathematical theorems involved, as well as semantic and ontological questions about the nature of information.

## Recommended prior knowledge

Note: This repo is only related to the last parts of the course (on coding & simulating quantum computers).
